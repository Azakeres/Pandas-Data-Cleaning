    "The data was a bit messy because of the large number of columns and non-alphabetic charecters such as (\" \", [] , '\"') in column names. So I began with cleaning the column names. Most of the columns have categorical data so I left those as is. I droped an empty column and a few other columns that had non-numric and non-categorical data (note: these columns maybe useful for specific types of analysis but i stuck with continous and categorical data). I converted the age column into int and droped rows with unreal age value (0, and <120). I clean the country names using the .replace method. And I droped all of the rows with NaN values. It may not always be useful to drop a large number of rows like I did here. If someone is looking at specific columns, they may be able to preserve more rows. at the bottom, I show the break down of the categorical data in a for loop. "
